# UART Kernel Driver Development

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the development and understanding of a UART kernel driver in Linux. The project aims to delve into the intricacies of Linux kernel programming, specifically focusing on UART communication, which is a critical component in many embedded systems and devices.

## Objectives
- Understand the architecture and communication protocols of UART.
- Develop a UART kernel driver compatible with Linux.
- Learn about kernel module development, including loading, unloading, and interfacing with hardware.
- Test and validate the UART driver in a Linux environment.

## Kernel Driver Project
- **UART Kernel Driver**: Developing a Linux kernel module for UART communication. The driver will handle serial data transmission and reception, interfacing with UART hardware on a given platform.

## Learning Resources
- **Linux Device Drivers** book for in-depth understanding of driver development.
- Linux kernel source code and documentation, particularly for serial and UART subsystems.
- Online forums and community discussions on kernel development and UART communication.

## Tools and Environment
- **Fedora Linux**: Primary development and testing platform.
- **VS Code**: Preferred IDE for writing and debugging code.
- **Virtual Machines or Hardware Platforms**: For testing the UART driver in different environments and with various UART devices.

## Progress and Milestones
- [ ] Research and understand UART protocol and its implementation in Linux.
- [ ] Draft an initial design for the UART kernel driver.
- [ ] Implement the basic UART driver functions (initialization, data transmission/reception).
- [ ] Test the driver in a controlled environment (e.g., virtual machine or specific hardware).
- [ ] Document the driver development process and challenges.

## Contribution and Collaboration
- Contributions to the code, especially in terms of optimization and extended functionality, are welcome.
- If you have experience with UART or Linux kernel development, your insights and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
